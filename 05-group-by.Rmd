# group_by()

## Code Together: Load Packages & View ipeds_distance

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(vized)

```

- In this section we're going to explore the `ipeds_distance` dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

ipeds_distance %>% 
  View()

```

- Brief Aside: When you aren't sure what a function does, use `?`. It works for datasets that are part of packages also.

```{r}

?ipeds_distance

```

- Based on what we've learned, there are lots of things we can do with this data. For example, calculate total headcount.

```{r}

ipeds_distance %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(headcount))

```

## Code Together: Introducing group_by()

- But what if want to know the totals by `distance_type` or `level`, or `distance_type` AND `level`?
- That's where `group_by()` comes in.
- Let's try it by `distance_type`.

```{r}

ipeds_distance %>% 
  group_by(distance_type, level) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(headcount)) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  mutate(total_by_level = sum(total))

```

- `group_by()` splits the results by the columns that you group by.
- How about `level` and `distance_type`?
- `group_by()` can be used with any of the five `dplyr` verbs we learned (other than `select`).
- Let's use `mutate()` to include a column with total by `level`.

## Your Turn: group_by() & summarize()

- Now I'd like you to take the `ipeds_distance` data set and combine with the pipe, `group_by()`, and `summarize()` to find the mean headcount by `level` and `distance_type`.
- What is mean headcount for graduate, all_distance students?

```{r}
ipeds_distance %>% 
  group_by(level, distance_type) %>% 
  summarize(mean_n = mean(headcount))
```

## Your Turn: Fill in the Blanks.

- Now I'd like you to do the following on the `ipeds_distance` dataset:
    1. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to calculate total headcount by `year`, `level`, and `distance_type`.
    2. Use `filter()` to get only the rows where `year` is equal to `2018`.
    3. Use `group_by()` again to group the data by `level`.
    4. Use `mutate()` to add a column that contains total headcount by `level`.
    5. Use `mutate()` again that adds a column that divides the column you created in Step 1 by the column you created in Step 4.
    
Don't forget to remove the underscore lines!

    
What proportion of undergraduate students took all distance education courses in 2018?

```{r, eval = FALSE}

ipeds_distance %>% 
  group_by(year, level, _______) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(______)) %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  group_by(_______) %>% 
  mutate(total_by_level = sum(total),
         prop = total / total_by_level) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(_______))

```

- Get in the habit of using `ungroup()`
