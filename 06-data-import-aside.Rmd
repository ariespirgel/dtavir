# Importing Data

- So far have been using data that is part of packages.
- Of course, at some point you'll have your own data.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

```

```{r}
# import CSV 
sector_csv <- read_csv("data-processed/ipeds-sector.csv")

# import Excel
sector_excel <- read_excel("data-processed/ipeds-sector.xlsx")
```

- Other import functions (may need to dowload other packages):
  - read_tsv: tab separated
  - read_delim: general delimited
  - read_fwf: fixed with
  - read_sas: SAS
  - read_sav: SPSS
  - read_dta: Stata
  - ...
- Most have `write_*` analogs.
- Why do the paths above work (e.g., as opposed to using "users/spirgel/desktop...")?
  - Absolute vs. Relative Paths
  - R projects
